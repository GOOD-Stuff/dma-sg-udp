# dma-sg-udp
Example of transfer UDP packets from custom IP Counter which transfer data to AXI DMA with SG mode and then via AXI Ethernet with jumbo frames. 

For work with AXI DMA in scatter/gather mode without Linux driver I take this project https://github.com/OpenDGPS/zynq-axi-dma-sg. I appreciate and most grateful him  for the instance.

Project work with Zynq 7010. Linux kernel version of 3.17.0. Vivado version 2016.1.
